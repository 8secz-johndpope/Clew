These motion estimates are based on tracking elements in the environment visually (using your phone's camera) and on motion estimates from inertial sensors in your phone. While this technology is advanced, it does not work perfectly. You should expect that over very long routes, particular ones with limited visual features or poor lighting, that the accuracy of the tracking (and hence the app's guidance) will decrease. We have found that Clew works best when you navigate routes along the same direction as they were originally recorded (&quot;Start to End &quot; rather than &quot;End to Start &quot; navigation mode).";

We have found that the app works best when you hold the phone in portrait orientation with the rear camera facing directly ahead of you and the phone oriented vertically. Other orientations can work, but may result in diminished accuracy.";
