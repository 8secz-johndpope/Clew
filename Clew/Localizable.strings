Clew can be used in situations where you want to immediately navigate back to your starting location (e.g., if you went somewhere with a sighted guide or if it is harder to navigate the reverse journey) or when you want to remember a route that you are learning so you can navigate it more confidently in the future.  Importantly, Clew does not use your phone's GPS, so it can be used indoors.";
