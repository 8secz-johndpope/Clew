Clew can be used in situations where you want to immediately navigate back to your starting location (e.g., if you went somewhere with a sighted guide or if it is harder to navigate the reverse journey) or when you want to remember a route that you are learning so you can navigate it more confidently in the future.  Importantly, Clew does not use your phone's GPS, so it can be used indoors.";

"recomendedUsePrinciples" = "Clew relies on the position tracking technology provided by Apple's ARKit. These motion estimates are based on tracking elements in the environment visually (using your phone's camera) and on motion estimates from inertial sensors in your phone. While this technology is advanced, it does not work perfectly. You should expect that over very long routes, particular ones with limited visual features or poor lighting, that the accuracy of the tracking (and hence the app's guidance) will decrease. We have found that Clew works best when you navigate routes along the same direction as they were originally recorded (&quot;Start to End &quot; rather than &quot;End to Start &quot; navigation mode).";
